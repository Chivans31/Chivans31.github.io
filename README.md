# Welcome to My Portfolio!

## About Me
Hi! I'm **Chinenye**, a passionate data scientist with expertise in 
natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. I enjoy solving 
real-world problems using AI and have worked on projects like:

- **Sentiment Analysis for Football Player Valuation**
- **Food Image Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques**
- **Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Models**

### Experience
- **Machine Learning Engineer**, Afiari Inc., where I built and deployed predictive models for e-commerce platforms.
- **Data Scientist**, Huawei, where I developed data-driven insights for strategic decisions.

Currently, I’m exploring the applications of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **multimodal learning**.


## Projects
Here are some of my key projects:

### 1. Sentiment Analysis for Football Player Valuation
- **Description**: Identifying undervalued football players in the transfer market by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on football-related news articles
- **Technologies**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy, BERT
- **[View Project](https://github.com/Chivans31/football-player-analysis)**
  
### 2. Food Image Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques
- **Description**:  Evaluates and compares the performnace of the four deep learning architectures— Simple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Residual Networks (ResNet 18), a tuned Convolutional Neural Network named MyTuned CNN, and Visual Geometry Group (VGG 16) networks
- **Technologies**: Numpy, Matplotlib, PIL, Torch. Torchvision
